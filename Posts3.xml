What emerged out of that case is the idea that bug reports and feature requests are definitely off topic, but usage questions are generally on topic, as long as you allow them to arise naturally. So I suppose the same could apply for PETSc. I certainly don't see anything wrong with having a tag for a reasonably popular software package. In fact, I think it limits the usefulness of the site if people are forbidden from asking questions about usage of specific programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a distinction to draw between (1) questions about the actual application of PETSc (or any other package) to scientific computing tasks and (2) technical questions about the software, such as the one about the &lt;code&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt; option. The latter category is not really about scientific computing, except for the fact that it happens to be specific to a software package that is used for scientific computing, so one could make the case that it doesn't really belong on this site.

So in that context, here I go:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Math.SE&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Math is generally more abstract than what we do here, and tends to be oriented towards proofs and analytical calculation. Therefore, I would suggest that a question on the mathematical properties of an algorithm and/or the rigorous proof of such properties would be the domain of math.SE. For example, asking about how to make your prime-finding algorithm more efficient would be fine on scicomp, but asking how to prove that it is the optimal algorithm for primes larger than N (or whatever) is math.SE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Theoretical Comp.

They might want to tag their question with 'DFT', and they will use auto complete or the drop down list of suggested tags to help them find the right tag. If 'DFT' is not an option, what will be the result? Maybe this should resolve itself organically with more examples, but it might be worth having a strategy in advance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was a similar question on SO meta about this subject: &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/78923/ambiguous-tag-sts&quot;&gt;Ambiguous tag: sts&lt;/a&gt;. There the suggestion was to replace 'sts' with 'sts-option1' and 'sts-option2'. The option1 and option2 additions can be long. In the above 'dft' example, this would mean 'dft-density-functional-theory' and 'dft-discrete-fourier-transform'. Of course both examples would fail because they are too long to be acceptable tags. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what's the best approach?

Posters will still be able to type &quot;dft&quot; into the tag text box in questions, but it'll get replaced with the synonym upon posting. Since the system will perform the conversion automatically, there's no reason not to standardize on the longer, more descriptive name. (Despite everyone's best efforts, a lot of people don't read the tag wiki excerpts.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, for an ambiguous abbreviation which could mean two different things, it gets a little more complicated because you can't have multiple synonyms for one tag. But we should still definitely not have the tag exist on its own, because then people are going to use it and it'll make a mess of the semantic classification. What we can do is make use of the fact that when you're typing a tag into the text box, the popup that shows up will display any tags which include the string you've typed &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; whose synonyms include the string you've typed.

Similarly, there are intersections of scientific computing and theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, questions on the convergence of finite element methods, related error estimates, or the convergence properties of algorithms in numerical linear algebra are relevant for research in scientific computing. Explanations of these algorithms, of course, cannot be seperated from their proofs. This is de facto not in the domain of math.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the analytical properties of some partial differential equation are often relevant (or inspiring) for their numerical approximation. So questions like: &quot;Does the solution of this PDE blow-up?&quot; or &quot;Do we have this and that conservation property?&quot; can be very useful for the understanding of discretizations. I think it is within the resposibility of the user to decide whether it is better located in pure analysis (e.g, like some Besov-norm-estimates) or to scientific computing (e.g., when the stability of a numerical method depends on the well-definedness of trace operators).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is even more visible for numerical linear algebra. Any text book on that subject will include exercises on linear algebra which is canonical content of a mathematics program as well, and questions on these topics clearly belong to math stackexchange. Contrary, the convergence behaviour of the conjugate gradient algorithm - or even more algorithms like minimum residual method or Uzawa-type algorithms - depends on spectral properties of the underlying matrix. While spectral theory belongs to pure mathematics, its link to numerical linear algebra is to applied to belong to math.SE. The same can be said for the choice and understanding of preconditioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the intersection with theoretical computer science, a good example might be anything that involves randomness. The development of a good pseudo-random number generator is relevant. It is hard to draw a boundary here. For example, in simulations of protein folding or Ising models, the particular properties of a model might be relevant to design a pseudo-random number generator that is (slightly) better than standard constructs. (I am not very experienced with these applications).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other example topics, which are clearly draw from various sources of mathematics (and theoretical computer science) are questions on the geometric stability of mesh-refinement algorithms or (very recent) combinatorial preconditioners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the relationship with Stackoverflow, I think questions like &quot;How do I use STL&quot; or &quot;What is a fibonacci heap&quot; are much better located there.

I've also done some scientific software development, and would like to get more involved in understanding best practices in the community. I think this site is a great resource for people to learn more about scientific computing, especially since the field is still evolving as a discipline, and hasn't reached the point where it has gained widespread acceptance as an academic department. I was trained as a chemical engineer, and definitely wish that a site like this were around four or five years ago to answer questions I had as a PhD student starting out. I'd like to help this site get off the ground so that it can help current and future computational scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I'd like to be a moderator to help make the site better and grow its membership, as well as to connect with people in the computational science community. I contacted the people in my computational science fellowship program to post a description and links to the web site on their Facebook and LinkedIn pages. I've also been active on Meta, soliciting opinions about moderation and scope issues, and posting questions where I try to figure out how to help grow the site to emulate more mature Stack Exchange sites. As a pro tem mod, I've been active in commenting, voting, resolving flags, and closing (and even reopening) questions. I read and understood the Theory of Moderation before agreeing to mod, although since this is my first experience in moderating a forum, I expect my term as pro tem mod (and possibly elected mod) to continue to be a learning experience. One thing that I think I can do better as a mod is to continue to visit the Teacher's Lounge and solicit advice from experienced moderators and Stack Exchange personnel. So far, I've visited the Teacher's Lounge a few times to talk with other mods about migrating questions, and on some moderating matters, I've consulted the community for guidance. I think that in the future, I will use the Teacher's Lounge as more of a resource, in addition to what I've already done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I'm moderating in addition to interviewing for jobs and finishing up my PhD program, and so far, there don't seem to have been any issues with regards to the time I've put in. Given that an engineering PhD requires the same amount of time per week (40-70 hours per week) as a job, and that I'm applying to positions where I'd expect the same level of time commitment in a job (research staff positions and postdocs in computational science), I don't foresee the expected time commitment to be an issue. I would think that the most difficult times for me to moderate would be ramping up a project or around grant deadlines, but these should be temporary situations. If time commitments ever become an issue, I would step down as moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of having goals as a mod, I think the main things I'd like to do short-term would be to look at what David's done with the FAQ and help make it look more like the Math or Physics SE FAQs. I also plan on going to the Teacher's Lounge and talking to some of the mods of SE sites to get our site on their FAQs for question referrals. I'd like to see us more concretely define our scope, but I don't think it should be so narrow as to preclude the growth of the site, since if you look at our Area 51 statistics, we could use a bit of work on the number of questions per day, number of members, and number of site visits per day. I like how David Ketcheson has articulated a &quot;big tent&quot; philosophy, and I believe we should promote that philosophy while still maintaining a (mostly) distinct scope from related SE sites like Math, CrossValidated, Physics, and so on. There's been a lot of healthy debate on what the scope should be, and I'd like to see the outcomes of those debates transferred to the FAQ along with links to the relevant meta questions.

You need  to have a fair amount of expertise in both programming and your chosen field of science before you can even ask a question that falls under the domain of computational science. So the homework questions I'd expect to see on this site would tend to be more advanced than those on other science sites, and the people asking them correspondingly more educated. We shouldn't need to coddle them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The kinds of homework assignments one gets in a scientific computation class are usually pretty significant programming projects.

Obviously, if they're bad questions, we don't answer them; if they're off topic, we don't answer them; if they show zero effort on the part of the questioner, we don't answer them.

I believe that the author of the question, Dan, was looking for a list of journals when he asked that question. When &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/162/a-thread-to-request-questions-be-made-community-wiki&quot;&gt;the subject of community wiki came up in Meta&lt;/a&gt;, we eventually had a comment thread that discussed closing the question DavidKetcheson linked to. Dan and I both felt that the question probably should be closed unless community discussion tilts things the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am inclined to decide against questions that ask for explicit lists. The question &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1148/what-core-skills-should-every-computational-scientist-have&quot;&gt;What core skills should every computational scientist have?&lt;/a&gt; was well-intentioned and topical, but asked for a list of skills explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I draw a contrast between the linked question and a questions asking for software recommendations on the grounds that often times, questions asking for software recommendations don't necessarily need a list. If I ask about recommendations for a good numerical integrator or linear algebra package for a specific use case, I may get a list as an answer, but mentioning one or two software packages with sufficient commentary is appropriate and valid. Consequently, I don't consider software recommendation questions to be &quot;list questions&quot; unless the poster explicitly asks for a list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was my whole thought process, after doing all of the research; it was originally prompted by dmckee's (seemingly apoplectic) comment about list questions, and I asked about list questions a bit in the Teacher's Lounge to get a feel for it.

Opinion was divided, making it sound like these questions are sort of a corner case of list-type questions. The impression I get from the community (based on the current 8-2 total) is that we're going to allow these sorts of questions. Based on that response, here's my take on things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For starters, DavidKetcheson is right: some questions legitimately have lists as answers. Opinion questions (that ask for lists) for which there are &quot;no&quot; wrong answers (or rather, that allow a wide range of admissible answers) are definitely not suited to the SE format. They allow too much in the way &quot;me too&quot; answers that don't add much to the discussion, even though it's possible to have really good answers. However, questions like, &quot;What languages are most common in computational science?&quot; or &quot;What are good numerical linear algebra books?&quot; do have factual lists as answers, and thus, are reasonable questions on their face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I believe we as a community need to be careful. A good answer to a recommendation question has some of the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It states reasonable recommendations (e.g., &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; is not an answer to &quot;What are good numerical linear algebra books?&quot;, but Trefethen and Bau is a reasonable recommendation).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It justifies &lt;em&gt;each&lt;/em&gt; recommendation in some way. (e.g., Trefethen and Bau is a good linear algebra book because it gives a broad overview of numerical algebra in a clear, expository format. Breaking the book up into lectures makes it easy for self-study, and the examples they use often shed a new light on familiar concepts.) Sometimes, grouping recommendations can be okay; it depends.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It provides links where appropriate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I liked about the answers to the software question was that the better answers of that question had links, as well as paragraphs justifying the response with quotes from the aims and scope of the journals, or personal experience (either reading the journal, or experience submitting to the journal), and those justifications really put the recommendations into context. What I didn't like about some of the answers to that question was that they were a sentence or two stating that software was in the aims and scope for the journal recommended (in whatever subfield).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In that vein, I'm more inclined to think that a journal question is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a list question if answers tell me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Again, reasonable recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Something about the quality of the journal. Is it prestigious? Is it terrible? (I think it's fine, although perhaps impolitic, to recommend NOT to submit to a particular journal in a given subfield.) Is it widely-known, or is it more obscure?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who reads the journal? Is it a general audience journal, or limited to specialists? What disciplines do they come from?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What kinds of articles are in the journal? Are they more applications-based? Are they more methods-based? Do the journals require computational results? Do the journals allow proofs? Are articles shorter (a few pages) or longer (10-20 pages, or more)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Does the journal allow you to post pre-prints or post-prints on the arXiv? Do they allow supplemental material?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If I want to submit something, how long will it take them to turn around a review?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I say all of this because I too want to know what journals to read, and I've learned that not all journals are equal. Merely getting a list of journals doesn't help me (and it probably doesn't help anyone else), because my time (like everyone else's) is limited. If an expert tells me in what situations and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I should read a journal, I'm much more likely to actually try and read it than if they don't, and their answer is profoundly more valuable. If they give me a list without any of that information, it's virtually worthless to me, because they've given me no context. With minimal effort (a Google search), I could probably cobble together a list that answers the question. With some effort, I could probably answer some of the questions I posed about journals (read the aims and scope, skim some articles, hunt down the impact factor). To actually get an expert opinion on a journal I initially know nothing about would take &lt;em&gt;considerable&lt;/em&gt; effort, and I think those expert opinions are most likely to be valuable and save people time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a lot of the answers are short, or lists without justification, I'm much more likely to comment that I think the question isn't constructive, because it isn't a good example of what the SE sites can do when they reach their full potential. I think the answers to the PDE question could be better, and I think for these questions to have useful answers, the moderators (myself included) are going to have to keep an eye on them to make sure that we have good answers that are valuable for people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll also move to wikify any journal question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="276" LastEditorUserId="276" LastEditDate="2012-02-13T03:57:08.260" LastActivityDate="2012-02-13T03:57:08.260" CommentCount="4" />

Even Stack Overflow has these types of questions when they started out, but from what I understand, it got to be a problem because curating them became unmanageable. Now that the issue of &quot;list questions&quot; has been broached, it's becoming a topic of discussion while we figure out what that phrase even means.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Voting down and closing list-type questions makes the site cleaner&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I even get to the detailed answer (by which point people will TL;DR), one problem with list-type questions is that they're going to be very popular. By their very nature, they make it very easy to contribute. You're going to get good answers, and you're going to get crap. In addition to considering the community's input, really take a good look at decide whether you and the rest of the moderators, plus all of the other high rep users, are going to want to maintain the answers to these types of questions by cleaning out all of the crap, deleting old links, culling duplicates, getting people to update their answers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good example of the life cycle of a list-type questions is Kev's answer in &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112327/exceptional-cases-for-list-questions&quot;&gt;&quot;Exceptional cases for list questions&quot;&lt;/a&gt; on Meta Stack Overflow:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Here's what happens:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first 6 to 10 answers start out mostly ok because they're visible&#xA;  on the first page of the question and everyone can see if they're&#xA;  about to post a dupe link or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The next 11 - 20 answers provide maybe one or two new additions but&#xA;  because no-one can be bothered reading the first 6 to 10 answers&#xA;  duplicates creep in&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;After a month or so links start to rot on say 30% of the answers. Most&#xA;  of the folk who linked to dead destinations never respond to comments&#xA;  to fix the links. Mods are flagged to clean up these dead answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When the question is flagged and closed there's a big fuss made over&#xA;  it on the meta site. Moderators and sensible users, who see these&#xA;  questions for what they are, spend valuable time defending the closure&#xA;  and re-explaining the folly of such posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Peer pressure sees the question re-opened because of faithful promises&#xA;  to keep the question well maintained and as a canonical reference. The&#xA;  reality is that this doesn't happen, the question accretes more&#xA;  duplicate links and more links rot over time. Users and mods spend&#xA;  more time flagging, deleting, chasing to have links fixed, and what&#xA;  have you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The question is forgotten about and 5-10 more &quot;Best sites&quot; questions&#xA;  are asked, no-one can remember the canonical question and these new&#xA;  questions either get closed as &quot;not constructive&quot; or slip through the&#xA;  radar being upvoted and answered by users who should know better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And on and on and on it goes...until eventually after about two years&#xA;  the question is finally closed, locked and then thankfully dispatched,&#xA;  and you know what? Nobody cared or noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What a huge waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;These questions appear to be popular because they're easy to answer,&#xA;  everyone has an opinion and a favourite they want to show off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;As the months and years pass they degrade into sad, forgotten and&#xA;  unloved content just cluttering up search engine results with their&#xA;  uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mean, do you, as a potential maintainer of the site, really want to deal with that? I've badgered people already about answers to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1240/open-access-journals-in-computational-science&quot;&gt;Open-access journals in Computational Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1116/which-journals-should-i-read-to-keep-up-on-advances-in-solving-pdes-numerically&quot;&gt;Which journals should I read to keep up on advances in solving PDEs numerically?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and while I don't expect people to change their answers right away, I can see that checking periodically on each question like this might become a losing battle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we're early on in the life cycle of an SE site, so we have the chance to deal with this sort of hassle before it gets too too ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;The Long Answer&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in the spirit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/122120/the-great-question-deletion-audit-of-2012&quot;&gt;The Great Question Deletion Audit of 2012&lt;/a&gt;, let's go down the list:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1040/which-linear-algebra-texts-should-i-read-before-learning-numerical-linear-algebr&quot;&gt;Which linear algebra texts should I read before learning numerical linear algebra?&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Keep.&lt;/strong&gt; There's a small number of defensible answers here by experts. Could it be posed better so that it looks less like a list question? Yeah, probably. I'm not a fan of the answer that data dumped a list without any explanation. The key criteria I'd use here is: there are definitely wrong answers here, in that there are a small number of highly recommended linear algebra books, and to recommend anything other than those books would require a lot of evidence to back up said recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1014/what-are-some-applications-which-require-interval-arithmetic&quot;&gt;What are some applications which require interval arithmetic?&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Keep.&lt;/strong&gt; Again, there are wrong answers, and it's not as if anyone can just chime in (as opposed to the dense matrix question further down the page). Interval analysis is a pretty specialized topic within computational science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/943/what-kinds-of-problems-lend-themselves-well-to-gpu-computing&quot;&gt;What kinds of problems lend themselves well to GPU computing?&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Keep.&lt;/strong&gt; Not anyone in computational science can just chime in here. Only people who actually know stuff about GPUs could answer this question in a way that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/938/databases-of-results-for-numerical-codes&quot;&gt;Databases of results for numerical codes&lt;/a&gt;: &#xA;&lt;strong&gt;Borderline.&lt;/strong&gt; I'd keep it, but maybe reorganize the answers into a community wiki resource. There are definitely wrong answers to this question, but the barrier to entry is high (i.e., come up with a data set not mentioned, and have it be a bad data set with standard results).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/351/recommendations-for-a-usable-fast-c-matrix-library&quot;&gt;Recommendations for a usable, fast C++ matrix library?&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Borderline.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote this question, and originally, I set very specific guidelines on what I wanted, and then I wrote a long answer figuring that hey, people might want a summary of what I found out after doing research for a day. A lot of people like it, and it generated me a lot of rep (thank you for all who voted). I thought there weren't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; many C++ matrix libraries out there in popular use, but the answer has started to attract some good links and some bad links. We could wikify it, but I'd rather take myself out of that decision and leave it to other people because I'm biased about my own question. The problem I could see with closing this question on the grounds that it's a software question is going to be that there are so many software-type questions out there, and they make up a substantial fraction of the site. I think the more defensible reason would be, &quot;Anyone can wrap a 1-D array in a class to simulate a matrix, post it on their web site, and call it a 'Matrix Library'.&quot; So, in other words, it could be that this software request is too basic and that there are virtually no wrong answers, in which case, I should've asked a better question, and can try to edit it to save the question by eliminating upstarts and focusing on codes that have an institution behind them; this qualification should, in theory, make it easier for there to be wrong answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1300/algebraic-multigrid-code&quot;&gt;Algebraic Multigrid Code&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Keep.&lt;/strong&gt; Another software-type question.

Everything but the first sentence of this question is pretty specific in its scope; those sentences are limited to ViennaCL, cusp, and OCLTools. The problem is in the first sentence, &quot;I am looking for information from anyone that has tried to use OpenCL in their scientific code.&quot; It's too easy for someone to post about casual experience with OpenCL, and I don't think that's the intent of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1278/sparse-hermitian-eigensystems-are-there-better-techniques-than-arpack-or-trlan&quot;&gt;Sparse hermitian eigensystems: are there better techniques than Arpack or TRLan?&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Keep.&lt;/strong&gt; Either there are packages that are competitive or better than ARPACK and TRLan for the poster's problems, or there aren't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/252/where-can-i-find-a-database-of-simple-chemical-structures-in-xyz-format&quot;&gt;Where can I find a database of simple chemical structures in XYZ format?&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Borderline.&lt;/strong&gt; I could see this question going either way. Either there aren't that many databases for chemical structures, or the barrier to entry of this question is too low, and anyone can say something about structure conversion.

One of the problems I have with journal questions is that the potential for abuse is too great, which is why I wanted to close it. There are a lot of journals out there, and any exhaustive list would be long, which makes me think it's easy fodder for newcomers to the site. Part of me is a little concerned that the vote system could in some way be construed as a popularity indicator of journals.

SO is about &lt;em&gt;simple coding&lt;/em&gt; questions, so it's expected that whatever someone asks, there will be some (probably fairly standard) algorithm to do it, or some library function that can be offered up as an answer, perhaps with a short usage example. On the other hand, this site is more about &lt;em&gt;library recommendation&lt;/em&gt; questions, because the kind of things that one needs to accomplish as a computational scientist usually can't be done with 10 lines of code from the standard library of your language of choice. You usually need to find something that's already been written and packaged up. In other words, I see a lot of the value of this site coming from its ability to direct people to libraries of pre-written code that they might not have known about otherwise. Those kinds of questions inherently tend to attract more and more varied answers than the ones on simple coding, because there is much more freedom in how one can implement, say, a Monte Carlo integrator than in how one can implement (or even just &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt;) quicksort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But beyond that, I think even the &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of list questions has gotten a bit out of hand. After all, any question could be construed as being a list question since it will necessarily attract a list of answers (except for the occasional question that actually does have &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; one correct answer). So perhaps &quot;list questions&quot; isn't even the best term to use. As I see it, the thing that makes the formerly-known-as-list questions bad is that there is &lt;em&gt;no metric for evaluating the answers other than popularity&lt;/em&gt;. This kind of goes along with what Geoff wrote about good questions having wrong answers. Stack Exchange's niche is that it provides a very potent system for differentiating good (correct) answers from bad (wrong) ones. If people ask questions which are simply looking to collect a set of options, but where there is little sense in labeling one option as better than another, it's an abuse of the system. Those kinds of questions are better suited to a forum or poll site. I think that when the SE FAQ says &quot;practical, answerable questions,&quot; this is what it's getting at.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, consider what Kev wrote in the passage Geoff quoted, specifically this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The question is forgotten about and 5-10 more &quot;Best sites&quot; questions are asked, no-one can remember the canonical question and these new questions either get closed as &quot;not constructive&quot; or slip through the radar being upvoted and answered by users who should know better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since a good question inherently contains some criteria by which answers can be judged as good or bad, if the question is asked multiple times, you'd expect to get the same answer(s) rising to the top pretty much every time. On the other hand, the rating of answers to a &quot;list question&quot; is pretty arbitrary, depending on what people reading the answers tend to like. So if it's asked multiple times, you might get a whole different set answers from one instance to the next, and that sows confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, I want to make three points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This site may be able to get away with slightly more list-like questions than other SE sites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don't think all the questions you've mentioned here are actually list questions, or at least they're not all bad for the site&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Whether a question is &lt;em&gt;answerable&lt;/em&gt;, in particular whether it differentiates good from bad answers in a reliable manner, is a better criterion for identifying good vs. bad questions than is just classifying them as list or non-list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="103" LastActivityDate="2012-02-14T07:23:50.333" CommentCount="7" />

The former tags are more Googleable and descriptive than the latter. Even if tag wikis can mitigate the crypticness of acronym tags, not all tags have blurbs accompanying them; Paul deserves to be recognized for doing the lion's share of the work writing tag descriptions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;New tags should only be created if the question can't possibly be described by existing tags (which is why I created &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/interval-arithmetic&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'interval-arithmetic'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;interval-arithmetic&lt;/a&gt; recently) &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; there are &lt;strong&gt;so&lt;/strong&gt; many questions (at least 5 to 10) within an existing tag that can be grouped into a useful subcategory, in which case a tag should be created for the subcategory (i.e., if we get enough questions about  GMRES specifically, then we should create the tag &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gmres&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'gmres'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;gmres&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, it should go under something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iterative-methods&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'iterative-methods'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;iterative-methods&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tags are supposed to be a nice way of categorizing and indexing questions, and you can tag a question in at most 5 categories for a reason: more tags per question would likely be unwieldy. Having too many tags makes it more difficult to search through tags on the &quot;Tags&quot; page, and it then requires you to search by typing in the &quot;right&quot; category in the search box. Unless it occurs to you to search for &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/qmr&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'qmr'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;qmr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/minres&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged 'minres'&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;minres&lt;/a&gt;, you're unlikely to find those categories by browsing the tags because they appear at the very end of the list on the &quot;Tags&quot; page -- they are each associated with one question. Having not enough tags means that you have to filter through a lot of questions in a single category to find what you want.

I'd like to take advantage of this and work together as a community to formulate a series of questions (and responses) that serve as a definitive resource on the web for understanding the tradeoffs when not only selecting a programming language, but a series of paradigms to espouse as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a few suggested ground rules for getting these questions off the ground.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Edit the question to get it right (and don't get sidetracked)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to phrase these questions properly.

If you think something is distracting from the main thrust of the question and you are an expert in the topic, suggest or make an edit.  We have editorial powers on the website for exactly this reason.  If you find yourself at odds with another user over a series of edits, bring it here or to chat.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the above question, I have edited the original post and deleted several comments to avoid the derail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Not too broad, not too specific&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal of these questions is to provide factual, reference-backed (where possible), guidance to making decisions with respect to software design and implementation.  The questions should be phrased, when possible, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/1194/how-much-better-are-fortran-compilers-really&quot;&gt;elicit examples&lt;/a&gt; references, or authoritative experience to illustrate specific points.

Opinions count, but they are not as helpful as quantified facts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Illustrative examples are good too&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you can make a point with a figure, small set of equations, or a code sample.  When explaining language features or paradigms, this can help make a point on the usefulness or danger of a particular approach.  Try to provide examples to justify your answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Justify your expertise/authority&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, experience is the best reference we have available.

In other words, if you post on academia.SE, I expect the question to focus more on the academia aspects, whereas if you post here, I expect the question to focus more on the computational science aspects. My standard policy when I see any question cross-posted verbatim is to notify the other site, discuss scope, and then at least one question gets deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of our scope, I think career postings are on topic as long as they pertain to computational science.

Should all of the answers be wikified instead?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Points for discussion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The phrase prevents answers with both good and bad recommendations (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/a/353/276&quot;&gt;my answer here recommending C++ libraries for matrices&lt;/a&gt;, which has been deservedly criticized in the past for mingling both good and bad recommendations)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The phrase encourages answer bloat. If there are a lot of potential recommendations, and each recommendation gets a separate answer, there could be a lot of answers. If the question gets more than 15 answers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts&quot;&gt;according to Meta Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, the question and answer will be wikified.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's not clear if votes are on the user's answer, or the package recommended. A user could be a subject expert and potentially offer many recommendations, but if they're limited to one per answer, they need to post multiple answers to demonstrate their expertise; one user posting multiple answers is typically discouraged. Votes are supposed to reflect the quality of a user's answer, not the quality of the thing being recommended. Of course, if a user recommends something bad, and only something bad, the votes should reflect a bad answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="276" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2014-04-23T13:45:59.030" LastActivityDate="2012-04-16T02:39:18.243" Title="What should the policy be on the phrase &quot;One (book/solver/package/library/etc.) per answer please&quot;?"

I've seen it used well maybe once: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/46/where-can-one-obtain-good-data-sets-test-problems-for-testing-algorithms-routine&quot;&gt;Where can one obtain good data sets/test problems for testing algorithms/routines?&lt;/a&gt; and even there, it could be argued that a few of the data sets overlap (for example, there are a couple data sets that cover optimization test problems), and it would be better to condense the list, especially since the question has been wikified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's not wikify these questions. It's a slippery slope to bad things, as I alluded to in the comment thread to the question, but to repeat myself anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/&quot;&gt;wikifying questions is discouraged&lt;/a&gt;. Unwikifying questions that have been wikified is a separate issue to visit another time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you see an answer that is &quot;out of control&quot; in that it recommends both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; resources, you have a bunch of options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Flag it for moderator attention; ask for the answer to be wikified&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Comment; ask for the answer to be wikified (this option is less effective than flagging!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you're a 2K+ rep user, you can wikify it yourself&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Edit it before or after it's wikified&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The motivation for this proposal is simple: let's do the simplest, least disruptive things to address the real problems. The real reason people suggest &quot;One package per answer&quot; is to make filtering package recommendations easier, which solves the filtering problem, but does a whole bunch of bad things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It turns the question into a poll on packages, which is discouraged&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of answers gets larger and less manageable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It prevents making connections among software packages, as pointed out by JedBrown&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we just want to make filtering easier, let's just wikify answers that pose problems for filtering, like answers that recommend a mix of good packages and bad packages. It could be worthwhile to point out when a package is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; of good quality, or no longer maintained, so that newer or less expert users will avoid it. Wikifying those answers empowers users who are topical experts (regardless of their current reputation, as long as it is at least 100) to edit the question to correct or clarify misconceptions. We trust users to write good answers, so trusting them to step in and improve answers (which people already do) is a less intrusive approach more faithful to the Stack Exchange concept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wikifying the question causes other issues:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's frowned upon&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It means &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; answer will be community wiki, so no one can earn rep from the question, lessening the incentive for user participation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's avoid causing more problems than we solve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="276" LastActivityDate="2012-04-16T02:39:18.243" CommentCount="0" />

If you ask about how to do something in a software package that lacks the capability you're looking for, you're probably more likely to find someone on SciComp that can point you to software packages that do have the capability you're looking for, whereas on the package-specific board, you're probably more likely to get a response telling you that what you want to do in that software is impossible.

MathJax is a tool that lets us display LaTeX expressions on a browser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To use MathJax, enclose your mathematical expressions within single(&lt;code&gt;$...$&lt;/code&gt;) or double(&lt;code&gt;$$...$$&lt;/code&gt;) dollar signs. Single dollar signs make the expression &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt;, for example, &lt;code&gt;Let $x$ be a variable&lt;/code&gt; gives:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let $x$ be a variable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, double dollar signs make the expression a block element. It gets its own line, and is slightly larger. For example, &lt;code&gt;The equation of motion is as follows: $$v=u+at$$ It is a SUVAT equation&lt;/code&gt; gives:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The equation of motion is as follows: $$v=u+at$$ It is a SUVAT equation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the extra spaces in LaTeX do not render, use &lt;code&gt;\:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; for a space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Basic MathJax&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Superscripts and subscripts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can denote superscripts via the &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; character, and subscripts via &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;x^2&lt;/code&gt; renders as $x^2$, &lt;code&gt;x_1&lt;/code&gt; renders as $x_1$, and &lt;code&gt;x_1^3&lt;/code&gt; renders as $x_1^3$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to include more than one character in the super/sub script, enclose it in curly braces (&lt;code&gt;{...}&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;x^10&lt;/code&gt; renders as $x^10$, but &lt;code&gt;x^{10}&lt;/code&gt; renders as $x^{10}$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Fractions and square roots&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fractions can be easily displayed using &lt;code&gt;\frac{..}{..}&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;\frac{a+b^c}{de+f}&lt;/code&gt; renders as $\frac{a+b^c}{de+f}$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Protip: You can exclude the braces for single-character numerators/denominators (if the first character is a letter, you need to use a space after &lt;code&gt;\frac&lt;/code&gt;, though). For example &lt;code&gt;\frac12&lt;/code&gt; renders as $\frac12$, and &lt;code&gt;\frac ab&lt;/code&gt; renders as $\frac ab$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Square roots can be added in a similar manner, via &lt;code&gt;\sqrt{....}&lt;/code&gt;. For example, &lt;code&gt;\sqrt{x+y}&lt;/code&gt; renders as $\sqrt{x+y}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Greek letters&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Greek letters can be added usung a backslash ('\'), followed by the name of the letter. Captialise the first letter of the name for greek capital letters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eg &lt;code&gt;\alpha \beta \gamma \Omega&lt;/code&gt; renders as $\alpha \beta \gamma \Omega$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you put spaces after these if you are typing normal alphabet characters. Eg &lt;code&gt;e^{\pii}&lt;/code&gt; gives an error, you need to use &lt;code&gt;e^{\pi i}&lt;/code&gt; for $e^{\pi i}$.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that there are special commands &lt;code&gt;\varepsilon , \varsigma , \varrho , and \varpi&lt;/code&gt; to distinguish between the lunate Greek letters ($\varepsilon \varsigma \varrho \varpi$ rather than $\epsilon \sigma \rho \pi$).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Further reading&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help%3aDisplaying_a_formula&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Wikipedia TeX help page&lt;/a&gt; (extremely useful as a reference, useless as a tutorial)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.harvard.edu/texman/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Harvard intro to TeX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LaTeX wikibook, Math section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Advanced_Mathematics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LaTeX wikibook, Advanced Math section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/22/manishearth&quot;&gt;Manishearth&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.chemistry.stackexchange.com/a/88&quot;&gt;chem.SE answer&lt;/a&gt; on which this is based.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="149" LastActivityDate="2013-01-25T00:51:01.900" CommentCount="0" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-01-25T00:51:01.900" />

A beta site is, essentially, &lt;em&gt;fully functional.&lt;/em&gt; There’s no harm in staying in public beta, so long as the quality of the Q&amp;amp;A is high and the site does not become a ghost town. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the the graduation you are working towards brings some added benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A Site Design&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site gets its final design. The generic beta design is nice, but it is &lt;em&gt;generic&lt;/em&gt;, by design. After graduation, new visitors will see a &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; that fits the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;A Link in the Footer&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Computational Science SE will get a link at the bottom of every page in the Stack Exchange Network. The link in the footer is good for traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Moderator Elections&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final stage stage to establishing your governance. Early on, we &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/96/moderator-pro-tem-announcement&quot;&gt;appointed several moderators&lt;/a&gt; to engage the community in both the community-building issues and site management.

When a site graduates, the migration paths are activate which means that posts that are typically closed as &lt;em&gt;off topic&lt;/em&gt; can optionally be transferred to another site better suited for the content. You can receive &lt;em&gt;incoming&lt;/em&gt; content, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Network Lock-In&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Graduation tells the community (and everyone else) &quot;you finally made it.&quot; That's why we're waiting for that expected upturn in traffic site before launching the site. If all goes well, graduated sites also get some additional press/media/blog/article coverage from the notoriety surrounding a grand opening. That provides a nice source of traffic to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The risk of a site closing becomes substantially less the longer it exists. As long as it is showing steady progress and not drastically losing audience or deteriorating in quality, it is generally allowed to continue as long as it takes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This site has about doubled in visitors since this time last year, so there are no traffic problems of note. Community-wise, you typically know when a site is in trouble. You can just &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the faltering engagement as the site struggles to hold interest and attract new users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two blog posts that outline the criteria for graduation and when it's (not) time to worry.

Furthermore, people don't make much use of the voting facility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That may be due to the fact that people who are already comfortable with CVX aren't likely to hang around in a forum where there is nothing &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; support questions. What's nice about a more general forum like SciComp is that it that the diversity of topics and variety of expertise makes it an educational and enjoyable place to lurk, read, and occasionally answer.

There are lots of differences between different versions. They claim that all you need to know is some math and some Python and that going through the tutorial gets you ready to do the real ting, but that is simply not true. You really need to dive deep into the manuals, once you digress from the examples even slightly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you do dive into the manuals and go through the documentation, you will end up asking yourself questions that are exactly of the type: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How can you do X in FEniCS?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If those questions are not welcome here, then this is simply not the place to be a FEniCS support forum, since those questions are vital in the process of learning any language or software package.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3748" LastActivityDate="2013-05-29T03:37:00.843" CommentCount="6" />

Keep in mind that I know next to nothing about FEM and FEniCS. I liked questions like&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/7468/276&quot;&gt;FeniCS: Visualizing high order elements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/7204/276&quot;&gt;Poisson equation: Impose full gradient as boundary condition via Lagrange multipliers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;because the problems these users encountered had to do with FEM formulations. I think these sorts of questions are good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also liked &quot;How do I do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;_&lt;/strong&gt; in FEniCS?&quot; questions like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/7252/276&quot;&gt;FEniCS: custom quadrature rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/7111/276&quot;&gt;FEniCS: extracting points from a cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/7354/276&quot;&gt;FEniCS: how to access coordinates when writing an equation for a trial function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/q/7461/276&quot;&gt;Mixed FEM vector indices of pressure and velocity in FEniCS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I thought was good about these questions was that they clearly articulated what feature they were looking for. &lt;strong&gt;If code was used, it was a small snippet used to demonstrate clearly what they were trying to do, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; code they were looking to debug.&lt;/strong&gt; I think this distinction is important. I also think it's important that users show they've made some effort in trying to track down what it is they're looking for. I was a little conflicted about&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/7397/fenics-boundary-conditions-for-electrostatic-problems-with-dielectrics&quot;&gt;FEniCS: boundary conditions for electrostatic problems with dielectrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;because noxmetus &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; read the tutorial (Chapter 1 of the user manual, it seems?), but not the part of the user manual that covers this problem.

The answers to this were good; the conflict about &quot;Hey, did you read Chapter 9?&quot; wasn't so great, but that's why this whole thing is an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the &quot;How do I do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;_&lt;/strong&gt; in FEniCS?&quot; questions were bad:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/7430/extracting-subspace&quot;&gt;Extracting subspace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/7315/fenics-boundary-condition&quot;&gt;Fenics : boundary condition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mainly, what I think makes these questions bad is that they ask people to debug their code. And that's just not what this forum is about. Support forums are geared towards this sort of thing; I really prefer not to think of these questions as &quot;How do I do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;_&lt;/em&gt;___&lt;/strong&gt; in FEniCS?&quot;, but &quot;Can you debug my FEniCS code?&quot; And the answer to that question should virtually always be &quot;no&quot;.

Although I think it's still better posed on the FEniCS support list, I really like how it was resolved. I think we should focus on directing the debugging-type questions to the FEniCS support forum.

If a closed post is unanswered, and hasn't been reopened, I tend to delete it. However, bad posts that are answered shouldn't be deleted (by anyone other than the original poster); just vote the post down, and ask mods to close it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best way to stop the bad questions is to help the original posters edit them, or politely provide them advice on how to ask better questions. Politely directing them to existing resources is a good thing; telling them &quot;RTFM&quot; is not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The FEniCS answers are a good fit for the site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, I like the way questions have been answered, and I think people from the FEniCS community have been doing a good job of answering FEniCS questions (and some of them have been really good about answering other types of questions, too).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The verdict is still out on the experiment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that it's been three weeks, I think the experiment is going well.

(This is the reason developers want to have questions on &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; StackExchange site.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific expertise&lt;/strong&gt;: Ideally, users will not only get a solution to their problem, but also an explanation why the problem is solved this way (i.e., the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; together with the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;). (This should be the reason developers want to have questions on &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; StackExchange site. I want to make clear that I'm not saying the developers don't have the necessary expertise; just that there is more of it (and broader) here due to the larger audience, and there is already a culture of tackling questions in this context.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question does not make use of (at least!) one of these advantages, it is either better posed somewhere else or posed incorrectly. (More on that below.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding how to treat specific questions, I would hope to be as inclusive as possible -- for the sake of the askers and of the site -- in the sense that no topic is a priori off-topic as long as sufficient effort was made to leverage the above advantages (i.e., without sacrificing quality). For example, this means the question should&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it about &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; problem, not &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Provide code, but make it minimal so that it contains what and only what is necessary for this question (as brief as possible, as specific as necessary). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide (scientific) context.&lt;/strong&gt; This helps the answerer select the most appropriate from multiple possible solutions, and also catch cases where something is not working because the whole approach is wrong. In particular, it should be made clear that a valid answer to the question &quot;How do I do X in package Z?&quot; would be &quot;Don't do that in Z, use Y; here's how.&quot; (If this answer is not acceptable to the asker, it's a sign he's using the wrong forum.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the more software-related the question, the higher the bar on these points. Just as clearly, the burden is on the asker to convince the community in this respect. (I think that is already the practice in the community; there have been questions that were as software-specific as some closed questions but received up-votes and excellent answers because they were well-posed. This could be made explicit in the FAQ.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of how to treat questions that failed to convince the community. The difficulty here is that closing a question can mean two different things: The question is not welcome here (as in &quot;reject&quot;) or that it is not posed appropriately (as in &quot;major revision&quot;) but will be reopened if suitably modified. In principle, the difference shows in the reason for closing, but that is not always so obvious, especially to a new user coming from outside the SE network (especially, support forums). We should be much more explicit about this difference, both in the FAQ and the comments. (And my personal feeling -- at least from the latter -- is now that we do too much of the former, and not enough of the latter, which lead to some frustration. We could also use a &quot;minor revision&quot; option: Down-vote and leave a comment asking for improvement, but (publicly) give a grace period (e.g., 24 hours) before voting to close.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a related note, if the asker is not willing (or, more importantly, does not possess the necessary scientific, programming or language skills) to make his question pass those bars but someone (e.g., developers) thinks the question should be answered for the sake of the (software-specific) community, that should be acceptable as long as the question is also edited accordingly &lt;em&gt;by them&lt;/em&gt;. (Of course, that might send wrong signals; probably deserves a separate question on meta.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To end with a concrete suggestion: In addition to the general guidelines, the FAQ could also link to example questions that are considered good and bad, respectively, together with comments on what makes them so: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The following question was up-voted and received several helpful answers because...&quot; &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The following question was closed as too localized because it only asked about a technical problem with the software...&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;The following question was closed as off-topic because it asked about a specific implementation question without context&quot; or &quot;did not show that it wasn't already answered in the documentation&quot;, possibly adding &quot;(but would have been on-topic if ...)&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(This would have the added benefit of making visible the results the asker can expect for his question -- carrot and stick, if you will.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1804" LastEditorUserId="1804" LastEditDate="2013-06-04T13:44:18.867" LastActivityDate="2013-06-04T13:44:18.867" CommentCount="1" />

I don't know as I'm not active here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our goal for the proposal is to create a community of applied mathematicians working in finance, industry, and other areas not traditionally considered mathematics, as well as others who use mathematical modelling techniques in their work. This seems different from Computational Science, which based on your &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;help center&lt;/a&gt; is focused specifically on computational methods. While that could come up on a modelling site, I think we're often more interested in the principles behind constructing models rather than solving them. However, the help center could be wrong and it could be that such questions would actually be welcome here. With that in mind, here are my questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are questions about building models, modelling principles, what models already exist for a given system, and other similar modelling questions (which are not computational in nature) welcome here? If so, could the help center be changed to reflect this? You can see some example questions on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/57490/mathematical-modeling?referrer=TdGG1ieHAiJDGxDR-o9vQA2&quot;&gt;proposal page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this &quot;close enough&quot; that it would make more sense to expand the scope of this site to include modelling rather than making a new site? I do not know what this community is knowledgeable about. If it turns out that you have many people who are experts in modelling and are willing to expand your scope to cover things like modelling principles (and it makes sense to do so), then rather than going through area51 we can just come here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please don't hesitate to say &quot;no&quot; on both counts if this site is really focused on computational science and not on mathematical modelling.

Thus, it makes more sense to diagnose the problem in the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verify that your assumptions about the input and outcome are correct.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If correct, check to make sure that the equations and boundary/initial conditions reflect your assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If both 1. and 2. are correct, then debug the numerical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In lieu of a mathematical modeling SE site, I recommend posting questions about 1. and 2. in an SE website that most closely matches the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the problem.  In your case, electrostatics would definitely fall into the scope of the Physics SE site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your question is more concerned about debugging 3., then the computational science SE site is the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only my humble opinion.

The problem is, it's coming from some very large distributed networks. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, by the time a few have been rejected as spam, the system has been trained on them and they'll quickly be blocked. This data is shared across the network, so if someone goes and gets themselves blocked for spam edits on Ubuntu, they'll also be blocked here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much like your inbox, however, once evil has been identified and filtered, there's still some evidence of what &lt;em&gt;got&lt;/em&gt; them identified in your inbox that needs to be cleaned out - depending on the scale of the attack.

Several of those sites are in Area 51 and get an automatic advert like this one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/ads/proposal/28815.png&quot; alt=&quot;Computational Science&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other beta sites, on the other hand, tend to already be forming some sort of graphic identity and already have adverts that can be used to promote those betas on other SE sites. For example, take a look at the ones for &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/161/off-site-astronomy-community-promotion-ads&quot;&gt;Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.space.stackexchange.com/questions/364/ideas-for-off-site-space-exploration-community-promotion-ads&quot;&gt;Space Exploration&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/149/help-promote-robotics-with-community-promotion-ads-2014&quot;&gt;Robotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those adverts are particularly useful for promoting a beta site through the Community Promotion Ads on launched sites. Those are adverts which are shown on the right sidebar and which are proposed and voted on by the community of each site in a dedicated meta question (like, for example &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.physics.stackexchange.com/questions/5263/community-promotion-ads-2014&quot;&gt;this one from Physics.se&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what am I proposing? &lt;strong&gt;It would be cool if you guys can come up with advert ideas that can be used to promote Computational Science.SE in other related SE sites.&lt;/strong&gt; This community knows the strengths and selling points of the site best, so give it a go!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adverts in the Community Promotion 'range' need to follow some fairly strict guidelines, because they are automatically processed by the SE engine (i.e. they're taken straight from the corresponding meta question by an automated process). To inform your design process, I include a copy of those guidelines below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For clarity, I am not asking for adverts to show within Computational Science, but for adverts to promote it in other site. Beta sites do not have their own community promotion ads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will&#xA;  show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this&#xA;  question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are&#xA;  provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be&#xA;  shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to&#xA;  visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following&#xA;  things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources for physics research&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;interesting articles or findings for the curious&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your&#xA;  community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote&#xA;  information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's&#xA;  interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to&#xA;  join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other&#xA;  things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads&#xA;  every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served&#xA;  their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This&#xA;  helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject&#xA;  matter of the community, but to the current status of the community.&#xA;  We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an&#xA;  ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very&#xA;  valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good&#xA;  idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the&#xA;  process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale&#xA;  after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following&#xA;  rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

If the questions are mainly about things we already cover a lot on Computational Science Stack Exchange (numerical methods, general-purpose computational science software, computational fluid dynamics), it would probably be a good fit. I personally skew towards inclusiveness, because I think good communities try to be inclusive, and I think that if a topic isn't a good fit, we will see it over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I've seen so far is that application communities (or general niche communities) that start here generally drift away after reaching a certain mass: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used to get a number of computational chemistry questions; now these are answered more frequently on Chemistry Stack Exchange. Computational chemistry questions are still on-topic here, but if they don't get answered here, they'll probably get migrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got the odd Mathematica question here early on in the beta; now these questions are answered on Mathematica Stack Exchange, and we tend to migrate Mathematica questions there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, we tried being a forum for FEniCS. Now, FEniCS questions tend to get closed, and users are told to ask questions on the FEniCS Q&amp;amp;A site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physics tends to migrate computational questions to us. If a question is more about the physics of an application, it's a better fit for Physics Stack Exchange. If a user has a physics problem already set up with all of the equations, and wants to know how best to solve it using numerical methods and software, it's a better fit for this site. We occasionally migrate questions to Physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll get the occasional statistics or computer vision question; if it gets to be too specialized, we migrate it to the appropriate site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think one key is to try and get people who already visit the site to engage. Questions about general computational methods (what numerical methods should I use, what general-purpose computational science software packages should I use, etc.) tend to get answered. Questions about computational fluid dynamics get answered fairly frequently, and would also be a good fit. I think questions about application-specific models for ocean modeling and earth science would probably also be on-topic, if explained in terms accessible to general computational scientists, but they would be less likely to get answered by our current user base. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="276" LastActivityDate="2014-03-17T21:26:59.463" CommentCount="3" />

I have a strong background in Python, but it is only over the last few months that I have begun to dabble in scientific computation using scipy, numpy and most recently, Cython. This semester, I am taking my first proper course on numerical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, in my research work, I am writing a program that solves a large number of non-linear ODEs. I use &lt;code&gt;scipy.integrate.odeint&lt;/code&gt; as my workhorse, although I have dabbled with using &lt;code&gt;pyDSTool&lt;/code&gt; as well, but found that the limited capacity I had in understanding advanced methods didn't allow me to use &lt;code&gt;pyDSTool&lt;/code&gt; so that I had better performance than vanilla &lt;code&gt;scipy.integrate.odeint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My supervisor recently pointed out a fairly major error in my previous implementation of the program: I was &quot;breaking up&quot; &lt;code&gt;scipy.integrate.odeint&lt;/code&gt;'s flow. So if I had to solve a problem between times 0 and 10, I would make &lt;code&gt;odeint&lt;/code&gt; work between &lt;code&gt;t in [0, 1]&lt;/code&gt;, take the result at &lt;code&gt;t=1&lt;/code&gt;, use it to update (non-linear) parameters for the next interval (&lt;code&gt;[1, 2]&lt;/code&gt;) and then finally run the next interval using &lt;code&gt;t=1&lt;/code&gt; results as the initial conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be a good idea to do this in order to temporarily reduce the complexity of the problem by having some of the coefficients be constant over each sub-interval (something like a &quot;quasi-equilibrium&quot; condition?), and it also allowed me to straightforwardly implement non-DE rules to update parameters, if I needed to. However, problems with doing this include introducing errors, and causing loss of speed due to the breaking/restarting of &lt;code&gt;odeint&lt;/code&gt;'s internals. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I changed the implementation so that everything was done in &quot;one-shot&quot; (luckily the only non-DE rule I had so far was easily converted to a DE rule, although there is one coming up which I don't see any easy conversion for...&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/14765/scipy-integrate-odeint-how-can-odeint-access-a-parameter-set-that-is-evolving-i&quot;&gt;that is the subject of this question&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I am finding that the &quot;one-shot&quot; method is &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than the &quot;broken up&quot; method! For a single cell (the number of ODEs increases linearly with increasing number of cells), solving for the interval between &lt;code&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/code&gt; takes about 3 times longer than the &quot;broken up method&quot; (where I was breaking up the problem into intervals &lt;code&gt;[0, 0.5]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[0.5, 1]&lt;/code&gt; for the same &lt;code&gt;rtol&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;atol&lt;/code&gt;. Solving for the behaviour of a single cell over &lt;code&gt;[0, 10]&lt;/code&gt; takes roughly 3 times longer than &lt;code&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/code&gt; (hey! not bad!). Solving between &lt;code&gt;[0, 1000]&lt;/code&gt; takes roughly 1500 times longer (weird :( ). Solving 2 cells (and solving between &lt;code&gt;[0,1]&lt;/code&gt;) takes about 3 times longer than the single cell case, and solving 10 cells over the same time interval takes 60 times longer! So the times aren't growing linearly...whether I am increasing the length of the time interval, or increasing the number of cells. Alright, part of the problem can be explained by the fact that even though the number of ODEs grows linearly with the number of cells, the work done to calculate the Jacobian doesn't grow quite grow linearly -- still, in all cases, the &quot;one shot&quot; method is significantly slower than the &quot;broken up&quot; method (and the greater than linear effort required in calculating the Jacobian also affected the &quot;broken up&quot; method). Also, the Jacobian doesn't become harder to calculate when increasing the time interval...so shouldn't the time taken to solve the ODE grow linearly there at least? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alright, that's about all the certain information I have. My guess as to the number one culprit is that in the &quot;one shot&quot; method, the function used to calculate the Jacobian is doing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more work: recall, non-linear ODEs, so some internal iteration is required, and basically every iteration, all the coefficients are calculated again, while in the &quot;broken up&quot; method, I could choose which ones were held constant for a small time period, before recalculation. I thought reimplementing by making significant use of Cython (I used &quot;annotation profiling&quot; (&lt;code&gt;cython -a my_file.pyx&lt;/code&gt;) to make sure I am cutting down on C lines wherever possible...so I am pretty sure I have not done a horribly ugly Python to C conversion. Still, even Cythonizing doesn't help with the fact that a lot more work is being done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm at a bit of a loss right now as to how to proceed, so I clearly need help. Is scicomp.stackexchange the right place for it? Would I be better off mailing the scipy-users mailing list?

They all have different heights and widths(rectangles). These tiles values on each grid point need be copied and stitched to a &quot;world map&quot;. There maybe areas where a tile may not be available(e.g. over oceans). In which case zeroes or other values must be filled in. The world map itself has a bunch of square grids that constitute the coverage. I need to copy values from the original rectangle tile to the square tile making sure the latitude and longitude are identical. As you can see it is not a simple mosaic there is preprocessing prior to mosaicing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to pose your question on Computational Science Stack Exchange, you need to explain some of the GIS-domain-specific language you're using, because many users aren't familiar with GIS.

For instance, I don't know what &quot;mosaic-ing&quot; is, and I'm not familiar with tiles, so even though your question could have a simple answer, I can't get through the GIS-specific terminology to figure it out.

Here's why:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a while, we've had questions about software libraries on the site.

That's sort of died out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we tried an experiment with FEniCS where they would direct users to ask questions on SciComp, and FEniCS devs would answer them. That also didn't go well, because we seemed to experience extremes: the FEniCS questions would swamp out other questions on the site during FEniCS-heavy days, or the FEniCS questions would get buried in a sea of general computational science questions when fewer FEniCS questions were asked. I think the feeling from that experiment on both sides was that both communities were poorly served.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, the tendency is to close these &quot;how do I use this library&quot; of questions and refer them to software mailing lists, unless the software in question is so widely used (e.g., LAPACK, BLAS) that someone in the general computational science community is likely to give a sufficient answer. I think long-time users in the community have found that it dilutes the focus on software developers, because now they have to look at their mailing list and this site, and if they're not interested in answering general computational science questions, it's less time they spend doing their core work maintaining their software.

In most cases, there aren't enough power users or developers of these packages to answer these types questions here, and they tend to prefer answering these questions all in one place, on their mailing lists. Also, if the package has a larger, ardent user base, these questions can swamp out more general computational science questions on the site, as we found out with FEniCS, and if the package has a smaller user base, these questions can get lost in all of the other questions, as we found out with CVX.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've also discovered that recommendations on packages (e.g., Are there any packages that implement an incremental SVD?

I've explicitly pointed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear-system&lt;/a&gt; for the alternative. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a related note: There's about 10 questions tagged &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear&lt;/a&gt;, which seems in almost all cases to be redundant (although not consistently so; some are tagged &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear-system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear&lt;/a&gt;, others &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear-programming&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear-programming&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear-programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear&lt;/a&gt;). This can be remedied in the same cleanup round, but we might also wish to burninate the tag?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Actually, before going ahead, we should discuss the target tag: there's both &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear-solver&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear-solver&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear-solver&lt;/a&gt; (182 questions) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear-system&lt;/a&gt; (21 questions). Do we want to pick one over the other? Make them synonyms? Treat (and document) them as different (e.g., the former is for questions about algorithms or code, the latter for questions about the mathematical properties -- that would be a massive effort, though)? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Thinking about this, I'd propose to deprecate &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear-system&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear-system&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear-system&lt;/a&gt; in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/linear-solver&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;linear-solver&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;linear-solver&lt;/a&gt;: Most questions with the former have both tags anyway, and the few that are not about solvers can be retagged as &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/matrix&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;matrix&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;matrix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3:&lt;/strong&gt; I've completed retagging all (in my opinion) mistagged questions with &lt;a href=&quot;http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/matrix-equations&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;matrix-equations&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;matrix-equations&lt;/a&gt;.
